# KomA_PlotComplexFunction
plots complex functions

a more detailed readme will follow.

this program is just to get a image on how complex functions move things around in the complex numberarea.

you define a area, most likely around (0+0i), from which we will take and calculate some points with a given complex function. the resulting
location of f(z) will be painted on the big Leinwand2D canvas on the right side, on the left side we plot f(x+iy) = (x, y, something), with
something determining Re(...), Im(...), Radius(...) and Arg(...).

in the settings you are able to change how the function is painted or calculated and you can define some functions in the input
numberarea that you would like to see transformed on the Leinwand2D canvas.

HAVE FUN and lets improve :)
